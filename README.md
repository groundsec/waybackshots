`waybackshots` is a straightforward tool designed for obtaining screenshots from archived web pages. It allows users to easily access and capture visual records of historical web content, making it an ideal solution for **pentesters**, **bug-bounty hunters** and **security researchers**.

The process to obtain the screenshots is the following:

1. A request is made to `https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=<url-to-screenshot>&output=json` to obtain the list of captures from the Wayback Machine
2. The items with repeated `digest` value are discarded
3. A screenshot is made for every item

In case a file has to be handled a pre-processing step is made to reduce the number of requests to the previously mentioned endpoint.

**Unfortunately, this tool is slow** due to limitations by the Wayback Machine itself; for this reason only one URL at a time is processed and there is a timeout for connection errors (that is incremented at every error and reset once the connection is established again).

The goal is to obtain a tool that meets the requirements of the community, therefore suggestions and PRs are very welcome!
